If you are here because `npm audit` or another tool told you there’s a vulnerability, please carefully review this template.

We also see these issues and regularly review them. If we identify a risk to our projects, we will fix them immediately. When we identify they are not a risk to our projects, there is nothing else we should do. 

Upgrading (when there’s not a risk to our projects) is a breaking change to our compatibility matrix and we don’t take these requests currently.

**Opening an issue for an npm audit / dependency vulnerability will result in a temporary ban.**
