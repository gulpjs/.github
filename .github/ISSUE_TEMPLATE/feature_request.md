## Our thoughts on feature requests

Lots of developers rely on gulp, so we don't make big changes very often. Not every feature request will be added to gulp, but hearing about what you want is important. Don't be afraid to submit a feature request!

### Describe your idea for a new feature

### Explain the problem your idea is trying to solve

### How will it benefit gulp and its users?

### If this feature could exist outside of gulp (like as a plugin or a module), would you be interested in helping to create and maintain it?
