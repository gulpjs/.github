If you are here because `npm audit` or another tool told you there's a vulnerability, please carefully review this template.

We also see vulnerability issues and regularly review them. If we identify a risk to our projects, we will fix them immediately. When we decide they are not a risk to our projects, there is nothing else we should do.

Upgrading (when there's not a risk to our projects) is a breaking change to our compatibility matrix and we don't currently take these requests.

It's uncommon for the npm ecosystem to backport security fixes to older versions that we rely on for our compatibility matrix. It would be a great help to the community if you could contribute a backport on the older release stream of the vulnerable package.

**If you open an issue like this, it will be closed and locked with no further reason. Continued offenses might result in a temporary ban to keep the noise down in our inbox.**
